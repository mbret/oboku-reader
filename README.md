@oboku/reader is an open source library for rendering ePub and other digital documents in the browser, across many devices.

## How does it works?

The project is composed of two main parts, the **reader** and the **streamer**. The reader purpose is to consume a document (a [manifest](https://github.com/mbret/oboku-reader/blob/master/packages/reader/src/types/Manifest.ts)) which represent a digital document. The streamer is a tool that will help you convert any document into a consumable manifest for the reader.

As you probably figured, the streamer and the reader are meant to work side by side. Although the reader requires a specific format to consume, it is not required to use the streamer if you want to implement your own custom streamer. So long as the manifest follow the [specs](https://github.com/mbret/oboku-reader/blob/master/packages/reader/src/types/Manifest.ts).

## Getting started (consumer)

```
npm install @oboku/reader
